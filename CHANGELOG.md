### AI Integration
- **Gemini Multimodal Analysis**: Processes video frames + transcript + metadata

- **Structured Exercise Output**: Complete exercise details (name, instructions, benefits, etc.)
- **Fallback Detection**: Keyword-based exercise detection when AI fails
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence levels for exercise detection

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE exercises (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    url VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    exercise_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    video_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    how_to TEXT,
    benefits TEXT,
    counteracts TEXT,
    fitness_level INTEGER CHECK (fitness_level >= 0 AND fitness_level <= 10),
    rounds_reps VARCHAR(200),
    intensity INTEGER CHECK (intensity >= 0 AND intensity <= 10),
    qdrant_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Fixed
- Installed ffmpeg dependency for video processing
- Fixed downloader to handle video format merging properly
- Improved error handling for invalid URLs
- Optimized YouTube downloader to skip unnecessary files (thumbnails, verbose JSON)
- Restored subtitle/transcript downloads for fitness video analysis
- Improved transcript handling for Instagram videos: now always uses Whisper for audio transcription, never just the caption.
- Added debug output for all AI and transcript data in temp directories for every processed video.
- Improved error logging and diagnostics for ffmpeg clip generation.
- Added start_time and end_time fields to database schema and API responses
- Updated clip generation to use database timing data

### Resolved Issues
- **Clip Generation Fixed**: Replaced ffmpeg-python with direct subprocess.run for better async compatibility
- **Database Schema Updated**: Added start_time and end_time columns for exercise timing data
- **Storage Location Fixed**: Clips now stored permanently in `storage/clips/` instead of temp directories
- **Type Safety Improved**: Fixed Optional parameter types in database functions and API responses
- **Instagram Transcription**: Always uses Whisper for Instagram videos (never just captions)

### Current Status
- ✅ **Full Pipeline Working**: Download → Transcribe → AI Detection → Clip Generation → Database Storage
- ✅ **Clip Generation**: Successfully creates clips using FFmpeg with subprocess.run
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL stores exercise data with timing information
- ✅ **Vector Search**: Qdrant integration for semantic exercise search
- ✅ **Permanent Storage**: Clips stored in `storage/clips/` with database metadata
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API with health checks, search, and statistics
- ✅ **Docker Deployment**: Production-ready containerization with FFmpeg, connects to external PostgreSQL and Qdrant
- ✅ **Carousel Support**: Automatic processing of Instagram carousel items with duplicate prevention
- ✅ **Data Cleanup**: Comprehensive delete endpoints for database, vector store, and file cleanup
- ✅ **Proper Carousel Implementation**: One URL → detect carousel count → download each item individually → process each video

### Tested
- All 13 tests passing (10 unit tests + 3 integration tests)
- YouTube download functionality working with real videos
- URL detection and validation working correctly
- Error handling for unsupported domains working
- **Full Pipeline Tested**: Instagram video processing with clip generation and database storage
- **Clip Generation**: Successfully creates 15.1s clip from 5.6s-20.7s timing data
- **Database Storage**: Exercise stored with complete metadata and timing information
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints tested and working correctly
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized application running successfully in production
- **Carousel Processing**: Instagram carousel detection and multi-item processing
- **Proper Carousel Implementation**: Correctly detects carousel count, downloads each item individually, processes each video without cascade effects

### Dependencies
- Added ffmpeg via Homebrew for video processing
- Installed pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock for testing
- Added yt-dlp, instaloader for video downloading
- Added ffmpeg-python for video processing
- Added asyncpg, qdrant-client for database operations
- **Installed all required Python packages**: fastapi, uvicorn, opencv-python-headless, openai, google-generativeai, asyncpg, qdrant-client, numpy, moviepy, openai-whisper, and more
- **Fixed environment variable configuration**: Updated to use correct variable names from .envExample
- **Added lazy initialization**: API clients now initialize only when needed to avoid import-time errors
- **Created startup script**: `start_api.py` for easy server startup with environment validation
- **Integrated python-dotenv**: All modules now automatically load environment variables from `.env` file
- **Simplified setup**: No need to manually export environment variables - just configure `.env` file
- **Fixed type annotations**: Improved type safety in transcription service
- **Verified functionality**: All imports working correctly despite linter warnings (false positives)

### Project Cleanup
- **Organized test files**: Moved all test files to proper `tests/` directory structure
- **Removed empty files**: Cleaned up empty documentation and configuration files
- **Updated documentation**: Enhanced README, CHANGELOG, and PROJECT_CONTEXT with latest features
- **Improved project structure**: Clean, organized codebase with proper separation of concerns

### AI Provider Enhancements
- **Gemini API Fallback**: Automatic fallback from primary to backup Gemini API key on failure
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when primary API key hits rate limits or quota
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear logging of which API key is being used for debugging
- **Environment Configuration**: Added `GEMINI_API_BACKUP_KEY` environment variable support
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added unit tests for fallback mechanism with 100% test coverage
