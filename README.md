# Fitness Builder

AI-powered fitness video processing pipeline that extracts exercises, creates clips, and enables semantic search.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Existing PostgreSQL database
- Existing Qdrant vector database
- OpenAI or Gemini API key

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cp env.production.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and API credentials
```

### 2. Build and Deploy
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Portainer Deployment
1. **Build the image** using the Dockerfile
2. **Assign network** to your existing PostgreSQL and Qdrant network
3. **Mount volumes** for persistent storage:
   - `fitness_storage` ‚Üí `/app/storage` (individual clip storage)
   - `fitness_compiled` ‚Üí `/app/storage/compiled_workouts` (compiled workout videos)
   - `fitness_temp` ‚Üí `/app/app/temp` (temporary processing)
4. **Set environment variables** from your `.env` file
5. **Expose port** 8000

**Note**: The container expects video clips to be stored in `/app/storage/clips/` inside the container, which maps to your host volume `fitness_storage`.

## üìä API Contract Documentation

### üîó Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```

### üìã Data Structure Concepts

#### Exercise Entity
An **exercise** in this system consists of three interconnected components:
1. **Stored Clip File** - Video file in `storage/clips/` directory
2. **PostgreSQL Row** - Metadata stored in `exercises` table
3. **Qdrant Vector** - AI embedding for semantic search

All three components are linked via `qdrant_id` and `database_id` fields.

#### Routine Entity
A **routine** is a complete workout structure containing:
- **Exercises Array** - Ordered list of exercises with UI-ready data
- **Metadata** - Database operations info (database_ids, qdrant_ids, video_paths)
- **User Requirements** - Original prompt and parameters
- **Processing Info** - Creation time, processing duration

---

## üèãÔ∏è ROUTINE MANAGEMENT (CRUD)

### Create Routine
**Generate intelligent workout routine from user prompt**

```http
POST /api/v1/generate-routine
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "user_prompt": "I want to get good at pull ups but i can only do 1 at the moment",
  "target_duration": 900,
  "intensity_level": "moderate",
  "exercises_per_story": 3,
  "initial_limit": 40,
  "score_threshold": 0.3
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "routine_id": "359072d3-b5f8-40e9-a79a-81283533c3d6",
  "routine": {
    "exercise_ids": ["c8c8d8dd-4223-44e9-88c7-f20695bc1e35", "a2de96ab-3d00-4d6f-9da5-0566a5b47002"],
    "metadata": {
      "total_exercises": 5,
      "user_requirements": "I want to get good at pull ups but i can only do 1 at the moment",
      "target_duration": 900,
      "intensity_level": "moderate"
    }
  },
  "user_requirements": "I want to get good at pull ups but i can only do 1 at the moment",
  "target_duration": 900,
  "intensity_level": "moderate",
  "created_at": "2025-07-26 06:08:17.423912",
  "processing_time": 34.79
}
```

### Read Routine
**Retrieve stored routine by ID**

```http
GET /api/v1/routines/{routine_id}
```

**Response:** Same structure as Create Routine response

### UI Integration Pattern

The routine generation API is designed for efficient UI integration:

1. **Generate Routine** - Returns exercise IDs only
2. **Fetch Exercise Details** - Use bulk endpoint to get full exercise data

**Example UI Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. Generate routine (returns just IDs)
const routine = await generateRoutine(prompt);

// 2. Fetch exercise details (same pattern as getExercises)
const exercises = await getExercisesByIds(routine.exercise_ids);

// 3. Combine for display
const routineWithExercises = {
  ...routine,
  exercises: exercises.map((exercise, index) => ({
    ...exercise,
    order: index + 1
  }))
};
```

**Benefits:**
- **Consistent API pattern** with existing `getExercises`
- **Reusable exercise fetching logic**
- **Smaller routine responses**
- **Better performance** (no data duplication)

}
```

**Response:** Array of exercise objects (same structure as individual exercise)

> **UI Integration Pattern:**
> This endpoint is designed to work with the routine generation API. After generating a routine (which returns `exercise_ids`), use this endpoint to fetch the full exercise details for display in the UI.

#### Search Exercises
```http
POST /api/v1/exercises/search
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{

GET /api/v1/exercises/deletion-preview
```

**Query Parameters:** Same as batch delete, but only shows what would be deleted

---

## üóëÔ∏è Verified Delete Workflow

When you delete an exercise using `DELETE /api/v1/exercises/{exercise_id}`:
- The exercise row is removed from PostgreSQL
- The associated video file is deleted from `storage/clips/`
- The vector is removed from Qdrant
- The API will return `{"detail": "Exercise not found"}` if you try to fetch a deleted exercise
- The file will not be present in the file system
- The vector will not be returned in semantic search results

This ensures **full cleanup** of all exercise data across the system.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/fitness-video.mp4"}'

# Test semantic search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/exercises/semantic-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "I need a beginner workout for my back"}'
```

## üåê UI API Base URL Configuration (LAN, Tailscale, or Public)

Your UI should NOT hardcode the API base URL. Instead, use an environment variable or config file so you can easily switch between:
- Local LAN (e.g., http://192.168.0.47:8000)
- Tailscale (e.g., http://100.x.x.x:8000)
- Public IP or domain

**Example (React):**
```js
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/v1/exercises`)
```

**Example (.env):**
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://100.x.x.x:8000
```

**Result:**
- UI works locally, remotely (Tailscale), or publicly by changing one variable
- Video clips and all API endpoints will work as long as the API is reachable

## üìÇ Static File Serving

The API now serves all video clips and files from `/app/storage` at the `/storage` URL path. For example:
```
http://<API_HOST>:8000/storage/clips/filename.mp4
```
No changes are needed to Docker volumes or the UI code. Just ensure the UI uses the correct API base URL.
